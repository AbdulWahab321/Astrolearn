### Discovery of Electron
![JJ Thomson Cathode Tube experiment](jjthomsoncathodediscovery.svg)
#### Conditions to be met for this experiment:
- High Voltage
- Low pressure

```
```

- Electrons are discovered by **J.J Thomson** by **cathode ray discharge tube** experiment
- The electrical discharge through the gas could be observed only at **very low pressure** and at **high voltage**
- When sufficiently high voltage is applied across electrodes, current starts flowing through a stream of particles from **negative electrode (cathode)** to **positive electron (Anode)**. These were called **cathode rays**. The flow of current from cathode to anode was checked by making holes in anode (**perforated anode**) and coating the tube behind anode with fluorescent or phosphorescent materials like **ZnS (zinc sulphide)**
- A bright spot on coating is developed when the cathode ray comes to contact with the ZnS

### Characteristics of cathode rays 
- The cathode rays start from **cathode** to move towards the **anode**
- They are invisible, but their behaviours can be observed with the help of phosphorescent materials (ZnS) 
- In the absence of electric or magnetic field, the cathode rays travel in **straight lines**
- In the presence of electric or magnetic field the cathode rays **behave** similar to that of **negatively charged particles** and from this, It is clear that the cathode rays consists of negatively charges particles called **electrons**
- The characteristics of cathode rays (electrons) **do not depend upon the nature of gas** and **materials of electrodes** and nature of gas present in cathode ray tube
