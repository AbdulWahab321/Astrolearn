### Discovery of Electron
![JJ Thomson Cathode Tube experiment](jjthomsoncathodediscovery.svg)
#### Conditions to be met for this experiment:
- High Voltage
- Low pressure


### Electron
- Electrons are discovered by **J.J Thomson** by **cathode ray discharge tube** experiment
- The electrical discharge through the gas could be observed only at **very low pressure** and at **high voltage**
- When sufficiently high voltage is applied across electrodes, current starts flowing through a stream of particles from negative electrode ()
