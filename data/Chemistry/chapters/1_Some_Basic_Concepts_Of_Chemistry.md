# Introduction/ Basics
Chemistry is the science of atoms and molecules

## Matter

- Matter is anything that has a definite mass and occupies a definite space.
- Matter is classified into solids, liquids and gasses based on physical classification.
- Solids have definite shape, volume.
- Liquids have definite volume, no definite shape.
- Gases does not have definite volume nor a definite shape. 
- Based on chemical classification, matter is divided into Pure substances and Mixtures
- An element contain only one type of substances and is classified into Elements and Compounds
- An element contain only one type of substance and is classified into elements and compounds 
- A compound contains 2 or more different elements
- Mixtures contains 2 or more substances and is classified into Heterogenous and Homogenous mixtures
- If composition of mixture is same through out it is homogenous. Its composition differ in a mixture, it is heterogenous

## Mass and Weight
Mass is the amount of matter in a substance. Weight is the force exerted by the gravity on a substance. It's unit is kilogram

## Volume
Space occupied by a substance, unit is $m^3$

## Density
It is the mass per unit length, unit is $kgm^{-3}$

## Temperature
It is the degree of hotness of a substance, units are:
- Kelvin
- Degree Celsius
- Degree Farenheit 

# Laws of Chemical Combinations
It is a set of five laws that governs formation of compounds from elements.

## 1. Law of conservation of mass
- It states that matter can neither be created nor destroyed
