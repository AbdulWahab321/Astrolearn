## Discovery of Electron
![JJ Thomson Cathode Tube experiment](jjthomsoncathodediscovery.svg)
### Conditions to be met for this experiment:
- High Voltage
- Low pressure

- Electrons are discovered by **J.J Thomson** by **cathode ray discharge tube** experiment
- The electrical discharge through the gas could be observed only at **very low pressure** and at **high voltage**
- When sufficiently high voltage is applied across electrodes, current starts flowing through a stream of particles from **negative electrode (cathode)** to **positive electrode (Anode)**. These were called **cathode rays**. The flow of current from cathode to anode was checked by making holes in anode (**perforated anode**) and coating the tube behind anode with fluorescent or phosphorescent materials like **ZnS (zinc sulphide)**
- A bright spot on the coating is developed when the cathode ray comes into contact with the ZnS

### Characteristics of cathode rays 
- The cathode rays start from **cathode** to move towards the **anode**
- They are invisible, but their behaviors can be observed with the help of phosphorescent materials (ZnS) 
- In the absence of electric or magnetic field, the cathode rays travel in **straight lines**
- In the presence of electric or magnetic field the cathode rays **behave** similar to that of **negatively charged particles** and from this, it is clear that the cathode rays consist of negatively charged particles called **electrons**
- The characteristics of cathode rays (electrons) **do not depend upon the nature of gas** and **materials of electrodes** and nature of gas present in the cathode ray tube
- These rays possess kinetic energy and hence can do mechanical work
- They can produce X-rays when incident on metal with high atomic mass

### Charge to Mass ratio of Electron
- **J.J Thomson** measured the charge (e) to mass ratio of an electron
- The amount of deviation of the particle from their path in the presence of electrical or magnetic field depends upon:
    - Magnitude of the negative charge (-ve) on the particle:
        - Greater the magnitude of the charge on the particle, greater is the deflection
    - Mass of the particle:
        - Lighter the particle, greater the deflection
    - Strength of the electrical or magnetic field:
        - Deflection increases as the voltage across the electrodes increases 
        - Deflection increases as the strength of the magnetic field increases
- J.J Thomson calculated the value of charge to mass ratio:
$$\frac{e}{m} = 1.758820 \times 10^{11} \, \text{Ckg}^{-1}$$
- **'e' represents the charge of electron**
- **'m' represents the mass of electron**

### Charge on the electron
- Charge on the electron was determined by **R.A Millikan**
- It was determined through **Oil Drop Experiment**
$$e = -1.6022 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}$$

### Mass of electron
- The charge to mass ratio of an electron was determined by Thomson as:
  \[
  \frac{e}{m_e} = 1.758820 \times 10^{11} \, \text{C kg}^{-1}
  \]

- The charge of the electron was determined by **R.A Millikan** by **Oil Drop Experiment** as:
  \[
  e = -1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}
  \]

- From the values of \(\frac{e}{m_e}\) and \(e\), the mass \(m_e\) of the electron was determined as:
  \[
  m_e = \frac{e}{\left(\frac{e}{m_e}\right)} = \frac{1.6 \times 10^{-19}}{1.758820 \times 10^{11}} \approx 9.1094 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg}
  \]

### Discovery of Protons and Neutrons
- **Protons** were discovered by **E. Goldstein** using a modified cathode ray discharge tube with perforated cathode.
- **Neutrons** were discovered by **James Chadwick** by bombarding a thin sheet of beryllium with \(\alpha\)-particles. 

### Charge and Mass of Subatomic Particles
| Particle  | Symbol | Charge      | Mass        |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Electron  | \( e^- \) | \(-1.6022 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}\) | \(9.1094 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg}\) |
| Proton    | \( p^+ \) | \(+1.6022 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}\) | \(1.6726 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}\) |
| Neutron   | \( n \) | \(0 \, \text{C}\) | \(1.6749 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}\) |


##### <Q::1. How was it proved that electrons are universal constituents of all matter?::{The ratio of charge to mass of electrons was found to be the same even if the nature of the gas taken in the discharge tube and material of electrodes is changed. This shows that electrons are present in all substances}>

## Discovery of Proton
- **E. Goldstein** found the **positive charge**
- **Rutherford** named the positive charge **proton**
- **Electrical discharge** carried out in a cathode ray tube led to the discovery of positively charged particles called **canal rays** or **anode rays**

### Properties of Canal rays
- They are positively charged ions that depend upon the nature of gas 
- Charge to mass ratio of canal rays depends upon the nature of gas
- Some of the positive charges carry multiple units of electric charge
- The behavior of these particles in magnetic or electric fields is opposite to that of cathode rays 
- The smallest and lightest positive ion was obtained from hydrogen and was called "proton"
- Charge on proton:
$$1.6022 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}$$
- Mass of proton:
$$1.67262 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}$$

## Discovery of neutron 
- Discovered by James Chadwick by bombarding a thin sheet of beryllium with alpha particles
- They are electrically neutral
- Mass of a neutron:
$$1.67493 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}$$

## Some important terms related to atom structure
### Atomic number (Z)
- It is the number of protons or electrons present in an atom
- **Z = number of protons**

### Mass Number (A)
- It is the total number of protons and neutrons in an atom
$$A = \text{number of protons} + \text{number of neutrons}$$
$$\text{(p + n) = Nucleons}$$
$$n = A - Z$$


### Isotopes
- **Isotopes** are atoms with **same Atomic number** but **different Mass number** 
Eg:

| Protium                | Deuterium              | Trituim                |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| $$^{1}_{1}\mathrm{H}$$ | $$^{2}_{1}\mathrm{H}$$ | $$^{3}_{1}\mathrm{H}$$ |
| $$^{1}_{1}\mathrm{H}$$ | $$^{2}_{1}\mathrm{D}$$ | $$^{3}_{1}\mathrm{T}$$ |

- Protium is ordinary hydrogen, while Tritium is radioactive
