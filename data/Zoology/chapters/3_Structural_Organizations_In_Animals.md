# Indian Bullfrog (*Rana tigrina*)


| Phylum   | Class    |
| -------- | -------- |
| Chordata | Amphibia |

- Is an amphibian
- Cold blooded animals (**poikilotherm**)
- They exhibit **camoflague** 
- During peak summer, the frogs  enter a state of **aestivation**
- During peak winter they **hibernate**

## Morphology of frogs
- Males have vocal sacs, they produce croaking sound
- **Nictitating membrane** present for protection of eyes while in water
- Cobulatory pad present in males, for gripping
- Greenish color at the Dorsal side and pale yellow at the ventral side
- Body is smooth and slippery due to the presence of **Mucus**
- The body is divided into head and trunk
- Neck and tail are absent 
- Eyes are bulged and covered by Nictitating membrane
- Membranous tympannum (Receives sound signals)
- Forelimbs are 4 digits and hindlimbs are 5 digits, This help them to swim, leap, burrow
- Feet have webbed digits that help for swimming
- They exhibit sexual dimorphism (differentiation between male and female)

## Anatomy

### Alimentary Canal

![Frog Anatomy](OtherDiagrams/FrogAnatomy.svg)

### Digestive system of Frog

- It consists of Alimentary canal and digestive glands. In frogs alimentary canal short because they are carnivorous animals. 
- Alimentary canal consists of Mouth (Buccal Cavity), Pharynx, Oesophagus, Stomach, Intestine, Rectum, and Cloaca.
- Both the fecal matter, urine, and sperm is expelled out through this **Cloaca**.

#### Digestive Glands

- Liver and pancreas are the main digestive gland present in Frog.
- Liver secretes **bile** which is stored in **gall bladder** (Bile helps to break down fat).
- Pancreas secretes pancreatic juice that helps to break down Carbohydrate and Protein. 
- Both the **bile** and **pancreatic juice** are sent to **duodenum** (Duodenum is the 'C' shaped. beginning part of intestine) through a common bile duct.
- While food enter to the stomach, the gastric gland in the stomach that secretes HCl and Gastric juice
- **Pancreatic juice** and **bile** **combines** to form **partially digested food** is called **chyme**, enter to the intestine, bile and pancreatic juice gets mixed with chyme from here
- **Maximum absorption** of food take place with the help of **villi** and **microvilli**


### Respiratory system of frog
- Frog live in both land and water
- In **fresh water** frog **respire** through **skin**. This type of respiration is called **Cutaneous respiration**
- In land, they **respire** through lungs, this is called **Pulmonary respiration**
- Lungs are elongated, pink colored sac like structure present in upper part of **trunk region**
- During **aestivation** and **hibernation**, gases exchange takes place by skin through **diffusion**

### Circulatory system of frog
- In frogs **blood vascular system** and **lymphatic system is present**
- Vascular system of frog is well developed and closed type. It involves **heart, blood vessels, blood etc.**
- The lymphatic system consists of **lymph**, **lymph canal**, **lymph nodes**
- **Heart** is three chambered (**2 atrium**, **1 ventricle**) and is a muscular structure situated in upper part of the body.
- Heart is covered by **pericardium membrane**
- There is a triangular structure called **sinus venosus**, joining the right atrium. It receives blood through major veins called **venacava**
- Ventricle open into sac like structure known as **Conus arteriosus**
- Blood from the heart is carried to all parts of the body by **arteries (arterial system)**
- Veins collect blood form different parts of the body to the heart and form **Venus system**
- **Hepatic portal system** and **renal portal system** is present

#### Blood
- Blood is composed of plasma, and cells
- Blood cells are RBC, WBC and platelets
- RBC is nucleated and contain red colored pigment namely **Haemoglobin**
- Lymph is lack of few proteins and RBCs

### Excretory system of frog
- Frog excrete materials in the form of **urea**, so they are **ureotelic organisms**
- They have a pair of kidneys, urinary bladder, and cloaca
- Kidney is dark red, bean shaped, situated at the **posterior side** of the body, either side of vertebral column
- Nephron or **uriniferous tubule** is the basic unit of kidney
- Ureter act as **urinogenital duct** which opens into cloaca
- In females, ureter and **oviduct** opens separately in the cloaca

### Control and Coordination
- It involves both endocrine glands and nervous system
- Nervous system organized is into a central nervous system (Spinal cord and Brain) and Peripheral nervous system (Cranial nerves and Spinal nerves), Autonomous nervous system (Sympathetic, Parasympathetic)
- Brain is enclosed in **bony structure** called **brain box** or **cranium** and it is divided into **fore  brain** and **hind brain**
- The prominent endocrine gland is found in frogs are pituitary, parathyroid, thyroid, adrenal, and gonads etc

### Reproductive system of frog
- Frog have well developed male and female reproductive system
- **Male** reproductive organs consists of a pair of **yellowish ovoid testis** are found on upper part of kidney which is attached with a membrane called **Mesorchium**
-  **Vasa efferentia** are 10-12 numbered that arise from **testis**, they enter to the kidney and open to **Bidder's canal**, **Urinogenital duct** and finally to **Cloaca**
- Female reproductive organ includes a pair of ovaries that is situated near the kidneys without any connection
- A pair of oviduct arises ovaries and open to cloaca seperately 
- A mature female can lay 2500-3000 **ova** at a time
- **Fertilization** is external and take place in water
- Larval stage is tadpole and undergo **Metamorphosis** to form adult

## Sense organs

| Stimuli           | Sense Organ      |
| ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Touch             | Sensory papillae |
| Taste             | Taste buds       |
| Vision            | Eyes             |
| Smell             | Nasal epithelium |
| Hearing & Balance | Tympannum        |

## Importance of frogs
- Frogs maintain ecological balance, they are the important organisms found in food web and food chain
- They eat insects and protect crop from pest attack 
- In some countries, muscular legs of frog used as food by man
