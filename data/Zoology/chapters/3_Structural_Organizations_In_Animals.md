## Digestive system of Frog

- It consists of Alimentary canal and digestive glands. In frogs alimentary canal short because they are carnivorous animals. 
- Alimentary canal consists of Mouth (Buccal Cavity), Pharynx, Oesophagus, Stomach, Intestine, Rectum, and Cloaca.
- Both the fecal matter, urine, and sperm is expelled out through this Cloaca.

## Digestive Glands

- Liver and pancreas are the main digestive gland present in Frog.
- Liver secretes bile which is stored in gall bladder (Bile helps to break down fat).
- Pancreas secretes pancreatic juice that helps to break down Carbohydrate and Protein. 
- Both the bile and pancreatic juice are sent to duodenum (Duodenum is the 'C' shaped. beginning part of intestine) through a common bile duct.
- While food enter to the stomach, the gastric gland in the stomach that secretes HCl and Gastric juice
- Pancreatic juice and bile combines to form partially digested food is called chyme, enter to the intestine, bile and pancreatic juice gets mixed with chyme from here
