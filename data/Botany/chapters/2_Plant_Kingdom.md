# Taxonomy

## 1. Cytotaxonomy

Taxonomy based on cell structure, including:

- Chromosome number
- Structure 
- Behavior

## 2. Chemotaxonomy

Taxonomy based on chemical constitution.

## 3. Numerical Taxonomy

Classification based on numerous characters using computer techniques.

Kingdom Plantae is classified into **5 groups**:

# I - Bryophytes

Bryophytes are land plants but require water for sexual reproduction. They are known as the =="Amphibians of the Plant Kingdom"==.

## General Characters of Bryophytes

- Plant body is **Haploid** and **Gametophyte**.
- They are green, photosynthetic, and autotrophic organisms.
- Vegetative reproduction occurs by **fragmentation**.
- Asexual reproduction occurs through **Gemmae**, which are produced within **Gemmae cups**.
  - Example: **Marchantia**
- Sexual reproduction involves the **fusion of male and female gametes**.

## Lifecycle/Sexual Reproduction of Liverworts

- The male sex organ of Bryophytes is called **Antheridium**.
- Within the Antheridium, the male gamete **Antherozoid (n)** is produced.
- The female sex organ of Bryophytes is called **Archegonium**.
- Within the Archegonium, the female gamete, **Egg (n)**, is produced.
- The Antherozoid (n) released from the Antheridium moves through water to fuse with the Egg (n) within the Archegonium, forming a **Zygote (2n)**.
- The Sporophyte consists of three parts: **Foot, Seta, Capsule**.
- **Haploid spores** are produced in the Capsule through ==Meiosis==
- Spores released from the Capsule undergo **germination**.
- The Male spore develops into a **Male gametophyte**, and the Female spore develops into a **Female gametophyte**.
- Bryophytes exhibit **Alternation of Generations**.

## Alternation of Generation

The alternation between the **Haploid gametophyte** and **Diploid sporophyte** stages in the lifecycle of an organism is called **"Alternation of Generation"**.

# Mosses

.. WARNING:: Image not available
   Due to some limitations the image for this topic is not available

-  Antherozooid (n) produced within Antheridium fuse with egg (n) produced within  Archegonium to form **Zygote (n)**
-  Zygote develop into **Sporophyte (2n)**
-  Sporophyte composed of three parts - **foot, seta, capsule**
-  Haploid spores are produced within through **Meiosis**
-  Spores released from capsule undergo **germination** to produce primary protonema, which is unbranched
-  **Primary protonema** develop into **secondary protonema**, which is branched 
-  **Leafy stage** produced by secondary protonema develop into gametophyte (n)
-  Mosses also exhibit **Alternation of generation**

## Importance of Bryophytes 

-  They are the pioneers of ecological succession
-  They prevent soil erosion
-  Sphagnum is used for transport of plant materials due to it's water holding capacity 

# II - Pteridophytes

-  They are the first **They are vascular land plants**, having **xylem** and **phloem**
-  Plant body is **Diploid sporophyte** which is differentiated Root, stem, leaf
-  They exhibit **alternation of generation** 
- Examples:
	- **Neprolepis**
	- **Salagenella**
	- **Salvinia**
	- **Equisetum**


## Lifecycle or sexual reproduction in Pteridophytes 

.. WARNING:: Image not available
   Due to some limitations the image for this topic is not available

-  Sporophyte (2n) of **Pteridophyte** composed of three parts Root, stem, leaves 
-  Mature leaf having **sporangia (2n)** is called **sporophyll (2n)**
-  Haploid spores are produced within **sporangia (2n)**
-  Spores released from sporangia undergo germination to produce gametophyte called **Prothallus (n)** 

## Prothallus
- **Gametophyte of pteridophyte** is called **Prothallus**. It is **heart shaped, multicellular, green, photosynthetic, independent structure**
- Antheridia and Archegonia are produced within **Prothallus**
- Antherozoid (n) produced within Antheridia fuses with egg (n) produced within Archegonia to produce **Zygote (2n)**
- **Zygote** develop into **sporophyte (2n)** again

## Homosporous Pteridophytes
- Pteridophyte which produce either ==Microspores== or ==Megaspores== **only**
- Examples:
	- **Neprolepis**
	- **Pteris**

## Heterosporous Pteridophytes
- Pteridophyte which produce both ==Microspores== and ==Megaspores==
- Examples:
	- Salagenella
	- Salvinia
- ==Heterospory== leads to **seed habit**

## Cone/ Strobilus
- Cluster of sporophylls are called **cone** or **strobilus**
- Examples:
	- Salagenella
	- Equisetum
.. WARNING:: Image not available
   Due to some limitations the images of ==Salagenalla== and ==Equisetum== are not available

## Classification of Pteridophytes

-  **Psilopsida**
	- Examples:
		- Psilotum
-  **Lycopsida**
	- Examples:
		- Salagenella 
		- Lycopsidum
-  **Sphenopsida**
	- Examples:
		- Equisetum
-  **Pteredopsida**
	- Examples:
		- Dryopteris
		- Pteris
		- Adiantum

# III-Gymnosperms
- They are **naked seeded plants**
- Tallest plant, **sequoia (red wood tree)** is a **Gymnosperm**
- Plant body is **diploid sporophyte** which is differentiated into **root, stem and leaves**
- They have **xylem** and **phloem** (vascular tissues)
- They have **taproot system**
- Examples:
	- **Cycas**
	- **Pinus**
	- **Ginkgo biloba (Living Fossil)**
- Cycas have **corolloid root** with **cyanobacterial** association
- Pinus root have **fungal association** called **Mycorhiza**
- Leaves of Gymnosperms are **evergreen, large or needle like (Pinus)**
- Leaves are covered by **cuticle**, and have **sunkon stomata**
- Sexual reproductive structures are called **cones**
