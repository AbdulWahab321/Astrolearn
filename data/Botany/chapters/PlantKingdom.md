## Taxonomy

---
### 1. Cytotaxonomy

Taxonomy based on cell structure such as:
- Chromosome number
- Structure 
- Behaviour
### 2. Chemotaxonomy
- Taxonomy based on chemical constitution

### 3. Numerical Taxonomy
- Classification based on Numerous characters, with the help of computers

Kingdom plantae is classified into 5 groups:

## Bryophytes
---

- Bryophytes are land plants but they require water for sexual reproduction. Hence they are known as =="Amphibians of the plant kingdom"==
#### General Characters of Bryophytes
- Plant body of Bryophytes is **Haploid**, **Gametophyte**
- They are green, photosynthetic, autotrophic organisms
- Vegetative reproduction by **fragmentation**
- Asexual reproduction by **Gemmae** produced within **Gemmae cups**
	- Example: **Marchantia**
- Sexual reproduction by the **fusion of male and female gametes**

## Lifecycle/ Sexual reproduction of Liver warts
-  Male sex organ of Byrophyte is called **Antheridium**
-  Within antheridium, male gamete **Antherozooid (n)** is produced
-  Female sex organ of Bryophyte us called **Archegonium**
-  Within Archegonium, female gamete, **Egg (n)** is produced 
-  Antherozooid (n) released from Antheridia move through water and fuse with egg (n),  produced within Archegonia to form **Zygote (2n)**
-  Sporophyte is composed of three parts **Foot, Seta, Capsule** 
-  Haploid spores are produced within capsule through **Meioisis**
-  Spores released from capsule undergoes **germination**
-  Male spore develop into **Male gametophyte**, Female spore develop into **Female Gametophyte**
-  Bryophytes exhibit **Alternation of generation**

## Alternation of Generation
-  Alternation of Haploid gametophyte & Diploid Sporophyte in the lifecycle of an organism is called ==Alternation of generation==
