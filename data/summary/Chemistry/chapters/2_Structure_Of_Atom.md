## Discovery of Electron
- Found by **J.J Thomson**
- **Cathode ray tube** experiment
- On **High voltage** and **Low pressure**:
	- Current travels **cathode** --> **anode**, these were named **Cathode rays**
	- Current flow is checked by using **perforated anode** and coating the tube behind anode with fluorescent or phosphorescent materials **(ZnS)** 
- Bright spot on the coating is developed

### Characteristics of cathode rays
- **Cathode** --> **Anode**
- Invisible, behaviors are tracked using materials like **ZnS** 
- Electric and Magnetic field
	- Absent --> travels in straight lines
	- Present --> they deflects, its clear that they contain **negatively charged particles**
- Negatively charged particles are called **electrons**
- Do **not** depend upon:
	- **Materials of electrodes**
	- **Nature of gas**
- Possess **kinetic energy** and can do **mechanical work**

### Charge to mass ratio of electrons
- By **J.J Thomson**
- Deviation of particles depends on (In presence of magnetic and electric field):
	- Magnitude of **-ve** charge on particles
		- $\uparrow \text{Magnitude,}\uparrow \text{Deflection}$
	- Mass of particle
		- $\downarrow \text{Mass,} \uparrow \text{Deflection}$
	- Strength of Electric or Magnetic field
		- $\uparrow \text{Voltage } \text{ OR } \uparrow \text{ Magnetic field, } \uparrow \text{Deflection}$
- $\frac{e}{m_e} = 1.758 \times 10^{11}Ckg^{-1}$

### Charge of electron
- By **R.A Millikan**
- **Oil drop experiment**
- $e=-1.602 \times 10^{-19} C$

### Mass of electron
- $\frac{e}{\frac{e}{m_e}} = 9.109 \times 10^{-31}kg$

## Discovery of Proton
- **E. Goldstein** --> **Found +ve charge**
- Rutherford   --> Named +ve charge, **proton**
- Electrical discharge in a cathode ray tube led to the discovery positively charged canal rays.

### Properties of Canal Rays
- **+ve charged gaseous ions**
- depends on **nature of gas**
- $\frac{e}{m}$ depends on **nature of gas**
- Some particles carry **multiple unit of electric charge**
- Behavior, is **opposite** to that of **cathode rays** (in presence of magnetic or electric field)
- **Smallest/Lightest** **+ve ion** was from **Hydrogen**,was called **proton**
- Charge: $+e=+1.602 \times 10^{-19}C$
- Mass: $m=+1.672 \times 10^{-27}kg$

## Discovery of Neutron
- By **James Chadwick**
- By **bombarding** **$\alpha$ particles** on a thin sheet of **Beryllium**
- Electrically **neutral**
- Mass = $m=1.674 \times 10^{-27}kg$

# Some important terms related to atom structure

## Atomic Number (Z)
- **Z** = **no. of protons**

## Mass Number (A)
- $A = Z +\text{no. of neutron}$
- $p+n = nucleons$

## Representation
- $^{A}_{Z}\hspace{0.3em}\mathrm{X}$

## Isotopes
- $Z = same$
- $A = different$
- Eg: **Protium,Deuterium, Trituim**

## Isobars
- $Z = different$
- $A = same$
- Eg: $^{14}_{6}\hspace{0.3em}\mathrm{C}$ and $^{14}_{7}\hspace{0.3em}\mathrm{N}$

## Isotones
- $no.\ of\ neutrons = same$
- $Z = different$
- Eg: $^{14}_{6}\hspace{0.3em}\mathrm{C}$ and $^{15}_{7}\hspace{0.3em}\mathrm{N}$

# Atomic models

## J.J Thomson model of atom
- **Watermelon model**, **Plum pudding model**
- Atom has **spherical shape**
- Mass of atom is assumed as **uniformly distributed over the atom**
- Explained **neutrality** of atom

## Rutherford's nuclear model
- **Planetary model**

### Observation
- Most $\alpha$ particles passed through **straight lines** 
- Few, **deflected** in **small angles**
- A very few, deflected in nearly **180 degree**

### Conclusions
- Most **space** in an atom is **empty**
- **Heavy positive charged center** is present, **nucleus**
- Size of nucleus $<$ Size of atom
	- Radius of atom --> $10^{10}m$
	- Radius of nucleus --> $1fm$

### Postulates
- Most **mass** and **positive charges** are concentrated at **center**, called **nucleus**
- **Electrons** revolve in **circular paths** at **high speed**, called **orbits**
- **Electrons and nucleus** are held by **Electrostatic force**

### Drawbacks
- Failed to explain **stability of atom**
- Failed to explain **hydrogen spectrum**
- Failed to say about **electronic structure of atom**

# Wave nature of EMR
- By **James Maxwell**
- Charged particles --> accelerates
	- Forms **Electric and Magnetic field (EF and MF)**
	- $EF \perp MF$
	- Move as **waves**
	- Eg: **Light** 

## Features of EMR
- $EF \perp MF \perp\text{ Direction of propagation of waves}$ 
- **No medium** is required
- Moves in **vacuum** with **speed $(c) = 3 \times 10^{8}m/s$**


## Types of EMR
1. Radio waves
2. Micro waves
3. Infrared rays
4. Visible radiation
5. Ultraviolet rays
6. X rays
7. Gamma rays

## Equations
- $c=\lambda\nu \ ms^{-1}$
- $\bar{\nu} = \frac{1}{\lambda}m^{-1}$ 

# Particle nature of EMR

## Planck's Quantum Theory 
- Phenomenon of **Black body radiation**, first explained by **Max Planck** in **Quantum theory**
- According to this theory:
	- Atoms & molecules could **emit or absorb discontinuously** in **small packets** of energy called **quanta/photons**
	- $E\propto\nu$
	- $E=h\nu$
	- $h=6.626 \times 10^{-34}Js$

## Black body radiation
- Ideal body which **emits and absorbs all frequencies** of radiation is called **black body**
- Its radiation is called **Black body radiation**
- Frequency depends only on **Temperature**

## Photoelectric Effect
- **Ejection of electrons** by some **metals** when **light falls on it**
- Eg: **Alkali metals**, Rubidium, Cesium

### Characteristics of Photoelectric effect
- To **eject electrons**, the **incident light** must have a **minimum frequency** called **threshold frequency ($\nu_0$)**, corresponding **minimum work** is called **Work function ($W_0$)**
- The **Kinetic energy** of ejected electron **depends** on **frequency ($\nu$)**
- **Number of ejected $e^- \propto \text{ intensity of light}$**
- **Electrons** are **ejected as soon as light strikes** 
- $h\nu = h\nu_0 + \frac{1}{2}mv^2$
