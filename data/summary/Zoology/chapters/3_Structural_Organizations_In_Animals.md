# Indian Bullfrog (*Rana tigrina*)

| Phylum   | Class    |
| -------- | -------- |
| Chordata | Amphibia |

## Characteristics
- Amphibian, cold-blooded (poikilotherm)
- Exhibits camouflage
- Aestivates in summer, hibernates in winter

## Morphology
- Males have vocal sacs for croaking
- Nictitating membrane protects eyes in water
- Males have copulatory pad for gripping
- Greenish dorsal side, pale yellow ventral side
- Smooth, slippery body due to mucus
- Body divided into head and trunk; no neck or tail
- Bulged eyes covered by nictitating membrane
- Membranous tympanum for receiving sound signals
- Forelimbs: 4 digits; Hindlimbs: 5 digits (for swimming, leaping, burrowing)
- Webbed feet for swimming
- Exhibits sexual dimorphism

## Anatomy

### Digestive System
- Short alimentary canal (carnivorous)
- Components: Mouth (buccal cavity), pharynx, esophagus, stomach, intestine, rectum, cloaca
- Cloaca: Expels fecal matter, urine, and sperm
- Digestive glands:
  - Liver: Secretes bile (stored in gall bladder)
  - Pancreas: Secretes pancreatic juice
- Stomach: Gastric glands secrete HCl and gastric juice
- Intestine: Maximum absorption through villi and microvilli

### Respiratory System
- Cutaneous respiration in water
- Pulmonary respiration on land
- Lungs: Elongated, pink, sac-like structures in upper trunk
- Skin respiration during aestivation and hibernation

### Circulatory System
- Closed blood vascular system and lymphatic system
- Three-chambered heart (2 atria, 1 ventricle)
- Covered by pericardium membrane
- Sinus venosus joins right atrium
- Conus arteriosus connected to ventricle
- Arterial and venous systems
- Hepatic and renal portal systems present
- Blood: Plasma and cells (nucleated RBCs with hemoglobin, WBCs, platelets)

### Excretory System
- Ureotelic organism
- Pair of kidneys, urinary bladder, cloaca
- Kidneys: Dark red, bean-shaped, posterior body
- Nephron: Basic unit of kidney
- Ureter acts as urinogenital duct

### Control and Coordination
- Endocrine glands and nervous system
- Nervous system:
  - Central: Spinal cord and brain
  - Peripheral: Cranial and spinal nerves
  - Autonomous: Sympathetic and parasympathetic
- Brain: Enclosed in cranium, divided into forebrain and hindbrain
- Endocrine glands: Pituitary, parathyroid, thyroid, adrenal, gonads

### Reproductive System
- Male: Pair of yellowish ovoid testes, vasa efferentia, Bidder's canal, urinogenital duct
- Female: Pair of ovaries, oviducts
- External fertilization in water
- Tadpole larval stage, undergoes metamorphosis

## Sense Organs

| Stimuli           | Sense Organ      |
| ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Touch             | Sensory papillae |
| Taste             | Taste buds       |
| Vision            | Eyes             |
| Smell             | Nasal epithelium |
| Hearing & Balance | Tympanum         |

## Importance
- Maintains ecological balance
- Part of food web and food chain
- Eats insects, protecting crops from pests
- Muscular legs used as food in some countries
