This code creates:
<h5>&lt;Q::2. What criteria are used in the natural system of classification?::{</h5>
<ul>
<li>Morphology</li>
<li>Anatomy</li>
<li>Embryology</li>
<li>Phytochemistry</li>
</ul>
<p>}::&gt;</p>

Instead of removing "::{" and "}::" and putting it in a div like this:
<h5>
    <div class="question">
        <p>1. Who proposed the artificial system of classification?</p>
        <button class="q_and_a_button" onclick="">&gt; Answer</button>
        <p class="q_and_a_answer">Carolus Linnaeus</p> <!-- Instead of this it would be another html translated by markdown module>
    </div>
</h5>

The markdowns look like this:
